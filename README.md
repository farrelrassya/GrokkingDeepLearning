# Grokking Deep Learningg

A beginner-friendly guide to understanding deep learning from the ground up, building a solid foundation to master major deep learning frameworks.

## About This Book

Grokking Deep Learning was written to help give you a foundation in deep learning so that you can master a major deep learning framework. It begins by focusing on the basics of neural networks and then switches its focus to provide an in-depth look at advanced layers and architectures.

## Who Should Read This Book

This book is designed with the **lowest barrier to entry possible**. No prior knowledge is assumed in:

- Linear algebra
- Calculus
- Convex optimization
- Machine learning

Everything necessary from these subjects will be explained as you go. If you've passed high school mathematics and hacked around in Python, you're ready for this book.
